<h3>A tutorial which teaches you how to compile QScintilla, which is essential for QtLuaPad to be compiled.</h3>

= Introduction =

1) First of all you'll need the QScintilla library which can be found here: <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/qscintilla/download">QScintilla</a>.

2) Create a folder on desktop called <b>"QScintilla"</b> and extract the library into it. Then run Qt commandline. 

3) Now, you'll have to change your directory to the <b>"Qt4"</b> folder which is located inside the <b>"QScintilla"</b> folder on desktop.<br/>
<tt>You can change your directory by using the "cd" command. For intance: <b><i>cd C:/Users/Delirium/Desktop/QScintilla/Qt4</i></b></tt>

4) Now that you changed your directory to the <b>"Qt4"</b> folder, run these commands: <br/>
<tt>qmake qscintilla.pro</tt><br/>
<tt>mingw32-make</tt><br/>
<tt>mingw32-make install</tt>

5) If your build was successful run this command to finalise it: <br/>
<tt>copy %QTDIR%\lib\qscintilla2.dll %QTDIR%\bin</tt>

6) Copy your qscintilla2.dll to your windows/system folder and you're done!
